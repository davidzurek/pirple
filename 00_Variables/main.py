# First verse and chorus of the song
"""
Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
How do you mend when you're worlds apart?
Ooh, carry on
Ooh, from the start
Somehow, we fell in love, then fell right out of touch
And ooh, that was hard
But ooh, here we are
And it’s easier to walk away
Than to look for what would make you stay
Remember when we first met?
We were havin' so much fun
So, now, how can we both forget
Tellin' each other, "We’re the one"?
We would make love (We would make love)
At the drop of a hat
Remember that? (Yeah)
I remember you and me (You and me)
Close as any two can be (Two can be)
Now we're strangers in the night (In the night)
Awkward and uptight

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Both]
Oh baby, do you wanna make it better?
Uh, ha, do you wanna stay together?
Hey, if you do, then let's please
Make some new memories
